# File_Organizer

This application was my project which i developed with a team of 3 people for the technical contest conducted in our college.
What it does:
It reads all the file names and creates directories based on the scanned files extension(ex:.jpg,.mp4,.mp3 etc) and after creating the directories it just moves them into the respective directories clearing the clutter and organizing them according to file formats.
